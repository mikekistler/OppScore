# OppScore

A Jupyter notebook for calculating Opportunity Scores

This is a shameless port of JP Carrascal's [Opportunity Score R Script](https://github.com/jpcarrascal/OppScore).

I set up a devcontainer for this project, so you can run it with the devcontainer extension in VS Code
or in a GitHub codespace.
